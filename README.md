- This repository contains RMarkdown documents to reproduce the results figures
  for a research publication.  Each figure is self-contained with explicit
  inputs and library imports by using RMarkdown's knit and merge
  approach[^fn1].
  
- Although beyond the scope of this reproducible code repository, some
  supplementary figures are created alongside the results figures where
  convenient.  The workflow overview figures 1 and 4 are also beyond the scope
  because they do not involve code: figure 1 was created using BioRender.com
  and figure 4 was created using LaTeX.

- Download the input data from DOI 10.5281/zenodo.15102621[^fn2].

- To recreate the figures code, if necessary, edit the `config.R` file in the
  `R` subdirectory with the path to your downloaded data directory, then run
  these R commands to install the dependencies and then build the RMarkdown
  book:

  ```r
  ## Install the dependencies:
  install.packages(c("BiocManager", "remotes"))
  options(repos = BiocManager::repositories(), Ncpus = parallel::detectCores())
  remotes::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)

  ## Build the RMarkdown book:
  bookdown::render_book()
  ```

  The above workflow has been tested on Ubuntu 24.10 GNU/Linux, Windows 11, and
  macOS 15.3.

- An additional download contains the job submission scripts that generate the
  input data.  However, these scripts are fairly specific to the compute
  clusters[^fn3] on which they were run and require over a quarter million
  compute hours to complete and are, therefore, intended as reference rather
  than being part of a practical, fully-reproducible workflow.

    Center's Expanse cluster, and the University of Michigan's Lighthouse and
    Great Lakes clusters (these latter non-Purdue clusters were only used to
    split up running the 50,000 GranSim simulations).
