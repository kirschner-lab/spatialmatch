- This repository contains RMarkdown documents to reproduce the results figures
  and supplementary figures for a research publication.  Each figure is
  self-contained with explicit inputs and library imports by using RMarkdown's
  knit and merge approach[^fn1].  Note that some of the supplementary figures
  are created alongside the results figures.

- Download the input data from DOI 10.5281/zenodo.15102621[^fn2].

- To recreate the figures code, if necessary edit the `config.R` file in the
  `R` subdirectory with the path to your downloaded data directory, then run
  these R commands to install the dependencies and then build the RMarkdown
  book:

  ```r
  ## Install the dependencies:
  install.packages(c("BiocManager", "remotes"))
  options(repos = BiocManager::repositories())
  remotes::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)

  ## Build the RMarkdown book:
  bookdown::render_book()
  ```

- An additional download contains the job submission scripts that generate the
  input data.  However, these scripts are fairly specific to the compute
  clusters[^fn3] on which they were run and require over a quarter million
  compute hours to complete and are, therefore, intended as reference rather
  than being part of a practical, fully-reproducible workflow.

    generated by the spatialmatch R package

[^fn3]: Purdue University's Anvil cluster (primarily), San Diego Supercomputer
    Center's Expanse cluster, and the University of Michigan's Lighthouse and
    Great Lakes clusters (these latter non-Purdue clusters were only used to
    split up running the 50,000 GranSim simulations).
